## Propose changes via Pull Request
An issue should be opened describing the piece of work proposed and the problems it solves before a Pull Request is open. This lets the community members participate in the design discussion. We recommend that each Pull Request encapsulates one specific new functionality or fix. 

We recommend you open the Pull Request even if your work is not completed and have it marked as Draft until it is ready to be reviewed, in order to let the community members participate and help.

To open a Pull Request, please do the following:
- [Create an account on GitHub](https://github.com/join) if you do not already have one
- [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) this repository
- Create a new branch
- Propose your changes by opening a [new pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)

## Review process
Every new contribution will be reviewed by [MobilityData](https://mobilitydata.org/) and the [French National Access Point](https://transport.data.gouv.fr/).

Before accepting a contribution, the following criteria will be evaluated:
- Is the change proposed affecting any of the known projects that are based on this validator?
- Is the change proposed in line with the vision for this project?
- Would this addition be easy to extend? Is the design consistent with the rest of the project?
- Do the documentation or examples need to be updated to reflect the change?
